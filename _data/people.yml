  Bio: "I’m an Assistant Professor at the Department of Genetics, the BASE program, and the Department of Computer Science at Stanford. 
  I worked with Dr. Cole Trapnell at the University of Washington during my PhD to develop Monocle 2 and 3 for pseudotemporal trajectory analysis of scRNA-seq data. 
  During my post-doc, I worked with with Dr. Jonathan Weissman initially at UCSF and then Whitehead Institute and MIT to develop <a href='https://github.com/aristoteleo/dynamo-release'>Dynamo</> 
  to reconstruct RNA velocity vector field and make reprogramming and in silico perturbation predictions with metabolic labeling enabled single-cell RNA-seq. I recently also
  lead the development of <a href='https://github.com/aristoteleo/spateo-release'>Spateo</>, for advanced spatiotemporal modeling of single cells. My lab is currently focused 
  mostly on predictive modeling of single cells through a uniuqe synthesis of genomics and machine learning. Outside the lab, I like going to the gym, run and read all kinds of books."

  bio: "I'm an incoming postdoctoral researcher at the Qiu lab in Stanford. I received my PhD from the Department of Automation at Tsinghua University. During my PhD, I developed 
  new methods for tracking cellular dynamics, curated ensemble cell atlases, and applied them to immunological studies. My current research focuses on understanding cell 
  state transitions and exploring how cells give rise to tissues. In particular, I am interested in developing analysis methods for spatiotemporal cell dynamics and building 
  self-organizing models that perceive internal molecular signals and external interactions, with applications in <i>in-silico</> modeling for mimicking and perturbing organogenesis. 
  Outside the lab, I enjoy cooking and aquascaping."

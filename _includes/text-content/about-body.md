    <h2>Mission of the Qiu Lab</h2>
    <p style="text-align: left;">
        At the Qiu Lab, our mission is to unravel and predict the intricacies of gene regulatory networks and cell-cell interactions pivotal in mammalian cell fate transitions over time and space, with a special emphasis on heart evolution, development, and disease. We are a dynamic and interdisciplinary team, harnessing the latest advancements in machine learning as well as single-cell and spatial genomics. By integrating the predictive power of systems biology with the scalability of machine learning, we aim to achieve groundbreaking insights into mammalian cell fate transitions. Our approach is defined by a commitment to innovation, collaboration, dedication, and a deep desire to demystify genetics and developmental biology for human health and medicine.

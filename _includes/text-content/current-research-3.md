  <p>While Dynamo allows us to predict how cells transit in the gene expression space along the temporal axis, the Spateo framework allows us to predict how cells migrate in the physical space. But these two spaces are separate. It is thus critical to build predictive tools to unify both spaces to jointly learn spatiotemporal kinetics. However, spatiotemporal models, such as  partial differential  equations,  are challenging to directly learn from data, especially for high-dimensional biological systems. Fortunately, breakthroughs in Fourier neural operators, diffusion models, and other generative deep learning approaches, which incorporate functional learning, attention and diffusion process, respectively, have begun to show promise for addressing such challenges. We have achieved promising results with these approaches.</p>

<p>In the lab, we are pursuing the following key questions:</p>

<div class="col-sm-12 col-md-8 mb-sm-4">
  <li>How can we integrate RNA metabolic labeling with spatial transcriptomics to obtain real spatiotemporal datasets to power our machine learning model?</li>
  <li>How can we leverage graph neural networks and neuralODE, Fourier neural operators and others, to learn spatiotemporal kinetics?</li>
  <li>How can we jointly model cell growth, division, apoptosis, and migration with whole organ or embryo datasets in 3D space across multiple time points?</li>
  <li>How to <i>in silico</i> perturb genes at a particular time point at a particular spatial location to predict how such perturbations propagate over time and space?</li>

In the Qiu lab, we leverage the latest machine learning (ML) approaches, such as auto-encoders, graph/physics informed neural networks, transformers, stable diffusion, etc. to model how cells change their states across expression, epigenetic, proteomic, and even morphological levels during evolution, development, and disease. We integrate these scalable, yet often "black box," ML approaches with more explicit and interpretable "white box" systems biology methods, including dynamical systems, differential geometry, etc. to derive mechanistic and functional biological insights.

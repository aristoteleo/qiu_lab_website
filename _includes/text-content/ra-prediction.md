We pioneered the use of differentiable machine learning models to make non-trivial predictions beyond the scope of traditional methods. With these models, we can quantify not just the velocity of cell state changes, but also their acceleration, curvature, Jacobian, divergence, and more. These differentiable approaches enable us to decipher gene regulatory network dynamics and predict optimal reprogramming paths, identifying key transcription factors. Ultimately, this leads to <i>in silico</i> predictions of cell states and fate trajectories following various genetic, epigenetic, and environmental perturbations.

    <h2>Research Directions at the Qiu Lab</h2>
    <ul style="text-align: left;">
    	<li>
	    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Cell Differentiation and Maintenance:</span> 
        We focus on dissecting mechanisms of mammalian cell differentiation, reprogramming, and maintenance, including cardiac cells, using differentiable deep learning frameworks.
        </li>
	    <li>
		<span style="font-weight: bold;">Multi-Omics Integration and RNA Velocity:</span> 
        Our work integrates multi-omics data to harmonize short-term RNA velocities with long-term lineage tracing. We apply these methods to study heart development and congenital heart diseases.</li>
	        	<li>
		<span style="font-weight: bold;">3D Spatiotemporal Organogenesis Models:</span> 
        We are building predictive in silico 3D spatiotemporal models of mammalian organogenesis, particularly focusing on heart morphogenesis.</li>
	        	<li>
		<span style="font-weight: bold;">Foundational Models and Software for Transcriptomics:</span> 
        Our lab is dedicated to establishing foundational models and a software ecosystem for predictive and mechanistic modeling of single-cell and spatial transcriptomics. This involves leveraging breakthrough transformer and diffusion models from the field of machine learning.</li>

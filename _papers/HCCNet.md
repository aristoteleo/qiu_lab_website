As a complex disease, the development and progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) involves the interactions of 
multiple proteins, genes and miRNAs in various biological pathways, and it has been extensively studied with different 
high-throughput techniques. However, efforts to integrate multiple data sources at different levels, especially with 
regard to biological pathways and interaction networks, are still negligible in the HCC research field. We have built 
a database of the HCC network (HCCNet) by integrating interactions of multiple proteins, genes and miRNAs in biological 
pathways, and manually collecting all of the HCC-related genes and miRNAs from the literature in combination with 
a bioinformatic analysis of the collected HCC expression data (Supplementary information, Data S1). Currently, there 
are 37 811 experimentally confirmed protein-protein interactions (PPIs), 9 148 experimentally confirmed transcriptional 
regulatory interactions (TRIs), 114 miRNA-target gene interactions, 2 234 high-confidence HCC-related genes and 160 
HCC-related miRNAs available in the database. The database also provides an online graphic analysis tool to view 
the interactions among HCC-related proteins, genes and miRNAs. HCCNet is a helpful platform to explore the molecular 
mechanisms that underlie human HCC. The database can be accessed at http://www.megabionet.org/hcc.

Here, we present Scribe (https://github.com/aristoteleo/Scribe-py), a toolkit for detecting and visualizing causal 
regulatory interactions between genes and explore the potential for single-cell experiments to power network 
reconstruction. Scribe employs restricted directed information to determine causality by estimating the strength of 
information transferred from a potential regulator to its downstream target. We apply Scribe and other leading 
approaches for causal network reconstruction to several types of single-cell measurements and show that there is a 
dramatic drop in performance for ‘‘pseudotime’’-ordered single-cell data compared with true time-series data. We 
demonstrate that performing causal inference requires temporal coupling between measurements. We show that methods 
such as ‘‘RNA velocity’’ restore some degree of coupling through an analysis of chromaffin cell fate commitment. These 
analyses highlight a shortcoming in experimental and computational methods for analyzing gene regulation at single-cell 
resolution and suggest ways of overcoming it.

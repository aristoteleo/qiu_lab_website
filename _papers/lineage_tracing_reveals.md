Tumor evolution is driven by the progressive acquisition of genetic and epigenetic alterations that enable uncontrolled 
growth and expansion to neighboring and distal tissues. The study of phylogenetic relationships between cancer cells 
provides key insights into these processes. Here, we introduced an evolving lineage-tracing system with a single-cell 
RNA-seq readout into a mouse model of Kras;Trp53(KP)-driven lung adenocarcinoma and tracked tumor evolution from 
single-transformed cells to metastatic tumors at unprecedented resolution. We found that the loss of the initial, 
stable alveolar-type2-like state was accompanied by a transient increase in plasticity. This was followed by the 
adoption of distinct transcriptional programs that enable rapid expansion and, ultimately, clonal sweep of stable 
subclones capable of metastasizing. Finally, tumors develop through stereotypical evolutionary trajectories, and 
perturbing additional tumor suppressors accelerates progression by creating novel trajectories. Our study elucidates the 
hierarchical nature of tumor evolution and, more broadly, enables in-depth studies of tumor progression.

Single-cell trajectories can unveil how gene regulation governs cell fate decisions. However, learning the structure of 
complex trajectories with multiple branches remains a challenging computational problem. We present Monocle 2, an 
algorithm that uses reversed graph embedding to describe multiple fate decisions in a fully unsupervised manner. We 
applied Monocle 2 to two studies of blood development and found that mutations in the genes encoding key lineage 
transcription factors divert cells to alternative fates.

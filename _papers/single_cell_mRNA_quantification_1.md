Single-cell gene expression studies promise to reveal rare cell types and cryptic states, but the high variability of 
single-cell RNA-seq measurements frustrates efforts to assay transcriptional differences between cells. We introduce 
the Census algorithm to convert relative RNA-seq expression levels into relative transcript counts without the need for 
experimental spike-in controls. Analyzing changes in relative transcript counts led to dramatic improvements in 
accuracy compared to normalized read counts and enabled new statistical tests for identifying developmentally 
regulated genes. Census counts can be analyzed with widely used regression techniques to reveal changes in 
cell-fate-dependent gene expression, splicing patterns and allelic imbalances. We reanalyzed single-cell data from 
several developmental and disease studies, and demonstrate that Census enabled robust analysis at multiple layers of 
gene regulation. Census is freely available through our updated single-cell analysis toolkit, Monocle 2.

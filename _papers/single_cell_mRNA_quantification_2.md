Single-cell gene expression studies promise to reveal rare cell types and cryptic states, but the high variability of 
single-cell RNA-seq measurements frustrates efforts to assay transcriptional differences between cells. We introduce 
the Census algorithm to convert relative RNA-seq expression levels into relative transcript counts without the need for 
experimental spike-in controls. Analyzing changes in relative transcript counts led to dramatic improvements in 
accuracy compared to normalized read counts and enabled new statistical tests for identifying developmentally regulated 
genes. Census counts can be analyzed with widely used regression techniques to reveal changes in cell-fate-dependent 
gene expression, splicing patterns and allelic imbalances. We reanalyzed single-cell data from several developmental 
and disease studies, and demonstrate that Census enabled robust analysis at multiple layers of gene regulation. Census 
is freely available through our updated single-cell analysis toolkit, Monocle 2.

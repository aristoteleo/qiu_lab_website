The molecular mechanism underlying brain regeneration in vertebrates remains elusive. We performed spatial enhanced 
resolution omics sequencing (Stereo-seq) to capture spatially resolved single-cell transcriptomes of axolotl 
telencephalon sections during development and regeneration. Annotated cell types exhibited distinct spatial 
distribution, molecular features, and functions. We identified an injury-induced ependymoglial cell cluster at the 
wound site as a progenitor cell population for the potential replenishment of lost neurons, through a cell state 
transition process resembling neurogenesis during development. Transcriptome comparisons indicated that these 
induced cells may originate from local resident ependymoglial cells. We further uncovered spatially defined neurons 
at the lesion site that may regress to an immature neuronâ€“like state. Our work establishes spatial transcriptome 
profiles of an anamniote tetrapod brain and decodes potential neurogenesis from ependymoglial cells for development 
and regeneration, thus providing mechanistic insights into vertebrate brain regeneration.

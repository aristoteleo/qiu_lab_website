The sense of smell allows chemicals to be perceived as diverse scents. We used single-neuron RNA sequencing to explore 
the developmental mechanisms that shape this ability as nasal olfactory neurons mature in mice. Most mature neurons 
expressed only one of the ~1000 odorant receptor genes (Olfrs) available, and at a high level. However, many immature 
neurons expressed low levels of multiple Olfrs. Coexpressed Olfrs localized to overlapping zones of the nasal 
epithelium, suggesting regional biases, but not to single genomic loci. A single immature neuron could express Olfrs 
from up to seven different chromosomes. The mature state in which expression of Olfr genes is restricted to one per 
neuron emerges over a developmental progression that appears to be independent of neuronal activity involving sensory 
transduction molecules.

Spatially resolved transcriptomic technologies are promising tools to study complex biological processes such
as mammalian embryogenesis. However, the imbalance between resolution, gene capture, and field of view of
current methodologies precludes their systematic application to analyze relatively large and three-dimensional
mid- and late-gestation embryos. Here, we combined DNA nanoball (DNB)-patterned arrays and in situ RNA
capture to create spatial enhanced resolution omics-sequencing (Stereo-seq). We applied Stereo-seq to
generate the mouse organogenesis spatiotemporal transcriptomic atlas (MOSTA), which maps with singlecell resolution 
and high sensitivity the kinetics and directionality of transcriptional variation during mouse
organogenesis. We used this information to gain insight into the molecular basis of spatial cell heterogeneity
and cell fate specification in developing tissues such as the dorsal midbrain. Our panoramic atlas will facilitate
in-depth investigation of longstanding questions concerning normal and abnormal mammalian development.

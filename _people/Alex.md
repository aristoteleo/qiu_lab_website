bio: "Hi everyone! I am a first-year PhD student in the Department of Biomedical Data Science at Stanford. I believe that the beauty of biology requires beautiful math to model it: I develop methods to infer causal relationships in single-cell genomics data to understand fundamental problems in gene regulation and cell fate decision making. I also believe that building community in science is just as important as our work itself; I love planning concerts and hosting dinner parties!"

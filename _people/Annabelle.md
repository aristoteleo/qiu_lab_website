bio: "I am an undergraduate student pursuing bioengineering and materials science at Stanford University. In the realm of computation, I am interested in the applications of machine learning to generative drug design and the modeling of disease progress via the transcriptome. My previous research leverages bulk RNA-seq data and genome alignment algorithms to evaluate HERV-K transcription in the presence of latency-reversing HIV drugs. In my free time I enjoy writing plays, scuba diving, and baking new recipes."

bio: "Hey! I’m a first-year Genetics PhD student. I’m interested in computer systems that let us model and engineer the physical world, especially biology. Previously, I worked at FutureHouse and Datavant and studied Computer Science and Molecular & Cellular Biology at Berkeley. Outside of lab, I run, play volleyball, and enjoy a good book."

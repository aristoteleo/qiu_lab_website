bio: "I am a research scientist in Dr. Xiaojie Qiu's lab, specializing in developing 
novel methodologies for spatial and single-cell multi-omics and applying 
them to uncover mechanisms underlying disease evolution and 
embryogenesis. I earned my Ph.D. from the Chinese University of Hong 
Kong and completed my postdoctoral training at the City University of Hong 
Kong. Previously, I worked as a senior engineer in a leading genomics company and served 
as the director of the Genomics Core at Shenzhen Bay Laboratory.
My career has focused on advancing technologies in sequencing, 
microfluidics, and bioanalysis, as well as their practical applications in 
precision medicine. In the fields of sequencing and bioanalysis, my research 
highlights include: (1) Developing a fully automated digital microfluidic 
platform and kits for diverse library preparation techniques, including WGS, 
amplicon-, and target-capture-based methods. These innovations enabled 
applications in point-of-care metagenomic sequencing, preimplantation 
genetic screening (PGS), noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT), and cancer 
mutation detection. (2) Utilizing cutting-edge sequencing methodologies, 
such as 10X and Smart-seq-based single-cell sequencing, Stereo-seq-based 
spatial transcriptomics, and Oxford Nanopore-based single-molecule 
sequencing to facilitate discoveries including identifying a new strain of 
heritable hairless mice, detecting Dengue virus in patient blood samples, 
profiling gene expression in dissections from Aedes aegypti mosquitoes and 
investigating the pathogenesis of pseudomyxoma peritonei (PMP). (3) 
Designing and implementing kinetic-based room-temperature signal 
amplification methodologies for single-nucleotide variation (SNV) detection 
in artificial and patient-derived samples. (4) Developing multi-stimulation-
responsive single-chain nanogels for high-throughput detection and imaging 
of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in lung cancer patients' blood. In 
microfluidics, my previous projects have involved: (1) Designing and 
fabricating droplet-based microfluidic chips for real-time studies of 
biological kinetics. (2) Creating microarrays and microwells for culturing 
tumor spheroids for high-throughput drug screening. (3) Developing 
monodispersed DNA-barcoded microgels and microwells for cell isolation, 
single-cell sequencing, and artificial cell mimicking.
I am passionate about collaborating with experts across diverse fields to 
revolutionize technologies and deepen our understanding of developmental 
biology and disease pathology. Outside of work, I enjoy swimming and 
hiking."

bio: "I am a research scientist in Dr. Xiaojie Qiuâ€™s lab, focusing on developing spatial and single-cell multi-omics methodologies to study disease evolution and embryogenesis. I earned my Ph.D. from the Chinese University of Hong Kong and completed postdoctoral training at the City University of Hong Kong. Previously, I worked as a senior engineer in a leading genomics company and directed the Genomics Core at Shenzhen Bay Laboratory. My research centers on advancing sequencing, microfluidics, and bioanalysis technologies for precision medicine. I am passionate about cross-disciplinary collaboration to drive technological breakthroughs in developmental biology and disease research. Outside of work, I enjoy swimming and hiking."

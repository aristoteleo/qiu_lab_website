bio: "Hi, I'm an incoming postdoc at Dr. Xiaojie Qiu's lab at Stanford. I aim to decipher evolutionary patterns and rules in developmental processes of multicellular organisms by leveraging single-cell and spatial omics technologies. I received my PhD from the University of Tokyo, where I studied predictability in microbial genome evolution using phylogenetics, machine learning, and wet-lab approaches. In my free time, I enjoy walking outdoors and observing birds and other wildlife in their natural habitats."

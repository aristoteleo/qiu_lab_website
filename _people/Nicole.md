bio: "I joined the BASE team as a Research Project Manager. A Bay Area native and Boston College alumnus, I began my career as a health technologies research engineer at Apple. I then earned her Chemical Biology PhD from UC Berkeley, where I developed carbon nanotube-based nanosensors for brain imaging and viral detection applications in Dr. Markita Landryâ€™s lab. After graduate school, I returned to industry research at Thermo Fisher Scientific where I developed bespoke surface chemistries to improve high-throughput genomic sequencing platforms. I currently live by Ocean Beach with her partner, Alex, and Karl, the San Francisco fog. I love hiking, camping, roller skating poorly, and reading horror novels."

bio: "I am a postdoctoral researcher in Dr. Xiaojie Qiu's laboratory, focusing on developing tools for computational biology and genomics research. During my Ph.D., I developed computational methods and pipelines for spatial transcriptomics and single-cell Hi-C, enhancing data analysis frameworks to better understand complex biological systems. I specialize in bioimaging processing software and web-based platforms. One of my key projects was developing U-FISH, a deep learning-based method for detecting signal points in FISH images. By curating a high-quality dataset, the tool achieved robust performance across various data types. To make it accessible for non-expert users, I integrated U-FISH with large language models (LLMs), creating an intuitive, user-friendly interface. Additionally, I gained valuable experience at SciLifeLab, where I contributed to web programming and developed components for the Bioimage.IO deep learning platform. With expertise in computational biology, deep learning, and bioinformatics, I am passionate about creating innovative tools to advance research and collaborating with others to push the boundaries of the field. Outside of work, I enjoy fishing and cooking, which provide a perfect balance to my scientific pursuits."

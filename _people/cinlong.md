bio: "I am currently a research assistant working in the Qiu Lab. I received my Bachelor's degree in Molecular and Cell 
    Biology at UC Berkeley. There, I performed research on in-vivo visualizations of ocular lymphatics in murine 
    models and molecular mechanisms behind vessel formation. I also worked at the Los Alamos National Lab to develop 
    a neuromuscular junction model using iPSCs. I'm interested in morphogenesis and learning how to leverage machine 
    learning and multi-omic approaches. Outside of the lab, I enjoy drawing and listening to a broad spectrum of music."

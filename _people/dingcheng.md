bio: "I am visiting the Qiu lab at Stanford as an Undergraduate Visiting Research Interns. I am currently an undergraduate majoring in Bioinformatics at Peking University. My past research experience focused on investigating tumor microenvironment during immunotherapy, trying to interrogate treatment resistance mechanisms. Astonished by the fast development of artificial intelligence, I am particularly interested in exploring these biological problems using methods from AI. In my spare time, I enjoy playing table tennis and magic cubes."

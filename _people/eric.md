bio: "I am a lab manager and research associate supporting the labs within the BASE Program at Stanford. Originally from Alexandria, Virginia, I graduated from the University of Oregon with a degree in Human Physiology, and worked as a lab supervisor at a high-throughput COVID testing facility during the pandemic. I then enrolled in a master's program at the University of Pennsylvania, where I am currently studying Computer Science with a focus on data science. In this role I aim to support my team in conducting meaningful research projects, optimize the use of our lab resources, and further develop my computational research skills. Outside the lab, I enjoy working out, playing the bass, and I am a huge Oregon Ducks fan!"

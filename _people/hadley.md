She provides administrative support for the Qiu Lab, and helps to coordinate the day to day logistics. She is originally from the   Napa Valley, and attended Iowa State University and received a BS in Animal Science. She returned to the Bay Area after graduation to work as Lead Technician and Hospital Manager at an equine medical center in Portola Valley, while completing the Veterinary Allied Staff Education Program to obtain her RVT license. Hadley has since joined the BASE team as an Administrative Coordinator, and enjoys working with the PIs and lab members alike and learning about the research they are conducting. She also appreciates being part of a team that is truly making a difference. In her free time, Hadley likes to travel, hike, and show her horse in Western Pleasure competitions around the country."

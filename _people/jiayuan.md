bio: "I am a visiting researcher and collaborator in the Department of Genetics at Stanford University. With over 10 years of industry experience applying machine learning and deep learning to real-world challenges, I now bring this expertise to single-cell and spatial transcriptomics. My current research centers on developing foundation models and agentic workflows to enable scalable and reproducible analysis in single-cell and spatial transcriptomics. I earned my PhD in Computer Science from Michigan State University, where I was advised by Dr. Jiliang Tang. Outside of research, I enjoy playing basketball and traveling."

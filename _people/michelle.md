bio: "Michelle received a BA in Biology from the University of North Carolina at Asheville. Immediately after graduation, she entered the veterinary field as an assistant and thrived in the field, eventually receiving her Registered Veterinary Technician license in 2001. Prior to working at Stanford, she was the head nurse at Peninsula Equine Medical Center in Menlo Park where her duties included everything from front office work to ICU patient care to administering and monitoring anesthesia on 1000+ lb horses. She also has been an Adjunct Instructor at Foothill College in Los Altos, CA for the Veterinary Technician Program. <br/><br/> Since joining Stanford in 2004, her role has been overseeing the day-to-day needs of the laboratory and staff. In addition to providing administrative support to the PI's and researchers, she oversees the financial and regulatory aspects of our program. Michelle really enjoys being part of a team. Her 25+ years in the veterinary field has made her proficient at working with doctors, students, and staff members. Her degree and background in the medical field are useful tools to bring to the table, and she prides herself on being proactive, organized, and having a positive attitude. When not at Stanford, you can find her at the beach, hiking with her dog, or riding her horse."

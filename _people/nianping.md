bio: "I'm a postdoc at the Qiu lab in Stanford. My research ambitions are rooted in a profound interest in the organogenesis of heart and others, and the spatial-temporal fate determination of cells. I aim to integrate high-precision spatial multi-omics technologies with advanced machine learning techniques to pioneer insights into these complex biological processes. I received my PhD at University of Science and Technology of China, where I harnessed single-cell multi-omics technologies to unravel the immunological mechanisms behind tumors and infectious diseases. When outside the lab, I enjoy playing badminton."

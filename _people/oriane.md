bio: "I am the Research Program Manager for the BASE Initiative which entails supporting research projects and collaborations, securing grant funding, and developing scientific and professional development programming. I received a Ph.D. in Bioengineering from UC San Francisco/UC Berkeley where I studied cardiovascular tissue engineering and hold a B.S.E. in Biomedical Engineering from Duke University. Outside of work, I enjoy traveling, testing out new recipes in the kitchen, and exploring the outdoors with my two dogs."

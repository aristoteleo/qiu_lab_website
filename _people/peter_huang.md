bio: "Hello! I'm a CS PhD student at Stanford University funded by a NSF Graduate Research Fellowship. My research aims to develop machine learning algorithms to understand, treat, and reverse disease at the single cell level. Previously, I obtained my BS in Computer Science from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Outside of research, I spend my time running, hiking, and exploring new foods."

bio: "I'm an incoming postdoctoral researcher at the Qiu lab in Stanford. I received my PhD from the Department of Automation at Tsinghua University. During my PhD, I developed 
    new methods for tracking cellular dynamics, curated ensemble cell atlases, and applied them to immunological studies. My current research focuses on understanding cell 
    state transitions and exploring how cells give rise to tissues. In particular, I am interested in developing analysis methods for spatiotemporal cell dynamics and building 
    self-organizing models that perceive internal molecular signals and external interactions, with applications in <i>in-silico</> modeling for mimicking and perturbing organogenesis. 
    Outside the lab, I enjoy cooking and aquascaping."

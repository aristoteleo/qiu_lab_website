bio: "I am a visiting PhD student in the Qiu Lab at Stanford. I am based in the Theoretical Systems Biology group with Prof. Michael Stumpf at the University of Melbourne. My research focus is at the intersection of theory and experiment in modern quantitative biology -- how can we reconcile mathematical models of biological systems with large-scale data? Ultimately, can we learn governing principles for living systems that generalise across technologies, experimental conditions, and even species? To address this, I am using tools from applied mathematics and machine learning to better model and understand single cell multi-omic and spatial data. When I'm not at my desk, you can usually find me outside hiking, camping or participating in another outdoors activity."

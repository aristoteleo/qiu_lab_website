bio: "I am a visiting student researcher at the Qiu lab in Stanford. I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science and Engineering and Statistics and Probability at Michigan State University, advised by [Prof. Jiliang Tang](https://www.cse.msu.edu/~tangjili/) and [Prof. Yuying Xie](https://directory.natsci.msu.edu/Directory/Profiles/Person/101084). My research interests lie in deep learning and its applications to structured data and single-cell analysis. Currently, I am focusing on developing foundation models to enhance scientific discoveries in human health and diseases, leveraging single-cell data. You can find more about my research [here](https://wenzhuotang.github.io/). Outside the lab, I enjoy hiking and photography."

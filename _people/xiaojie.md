bio: "Iâ€™m an Assistant Professor at the Department of Genetics, the BASE program, and the Department of Computer Science at Stanford. 
    I worked with Dr. Cole Trapnell at the University of Washington during my PhD to develop Monocle 2 and 3 for pseudotemporal trajectory analysis of scRNA-seq data. 
    During my post-doc, I worked with Dr. Jonathan Weissman initially at UCSF and then Whitehead Institute and MIT to develop <a href='https://github.com/aristoteleo/dynamo-release'>Dynamo</a> 
    to reconstruct RNA velocity vector field and make reprogramming and in silico perturbation predictions with metabolic labeling enabled single-cell RNA-seq. I recently also
    lead the development of <a href='https://github.com/aristoteleo/spateo-release'>Spateo</a>, for advanced spatiotemporal modeling of single cells. My lab is currently focused 
    mostly on predictive modeling of single cells through a uniuqe synthesis of genomics and machine learning. Outside the lab, I like going to the gym, run and read all kinds of books."

bio: "I am a rotation graduate student from the Bioengineering Department in the Qiu lab. I am really into the topic of intercellular communications and transcriptomics analysis. In the Qiu lab, I will primarily focus on developing an optics-free method for spatial transcriptomics analysis. Out of the lab, I enjoy hiking and watching movies."

bio: "I recently graduated with a Computing Science M.Sc. degree from Simon Fraser University, Canada and will begin my Ph.D. studies at Stanford in the fall of 2025. I am interested in leveraging my background in machine learning,  particularly transformer-based models, to reveal the regulatory mechanism of biological processes and disease progression. I earned a B.E. in Computer Science and Technology from Zhejiang University and a B.S. in Computing Science from Simon Fraser University. When I am not in the lab, I love to explore nature."

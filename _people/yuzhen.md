bio: "I'm now a visting Computing Science M.Sc. student of Simon Fraser University, Canada. I am interested in leveraging my background in machine learning, 
    particularly transformer-based models, to reveal the regulatory mechanism of biological processes and disease progression. I earned a B.E. in Computer Science 
    and Technology from Zhejiang University and a B.S. in Computing Science from Simon Fraser University. When I am not in the lab, I love to explore nature."

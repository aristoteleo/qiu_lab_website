bio: "I am a visiting researcher at the Qiu lab in Stanford and currently a Ph.D. student at the University of Science and Technology Beijing, advised by Prof. Hongwu Du. My research in the Qiu lab focuses on developing deep learning-based algorithms for integrative spatial multi-omics analysis across epigenomics and transcriptomics. I aim to apply these methods to study embryonic development, tumor progression, and congenital diseases. Recently, I have developed OmicVerse (https://github.com/Starlitnightly/omicverse), a multimodal transcriptomics algorithmic framework. Outside of research, I enjoy photography, skiing, and traveling."

        <i>April 1st, 2024:</i> We are thrilled to welcome three talented students join us today: Yifan Lu, a visiting PhD student from Wuhan University in China; Stephen Zhang, a visiting PhD student from the University of Melbourne in Australia; and Harper Hua, a Masterâ€™s student at Stanford. Yifan will be exploring the exciting frontier of applying computer vision approaches to 3D spatial transcriptomics. Stephen has made some exceptional work in single-cell dynamics modeling using optimal transport and is planning to develop spatiotemporal models of single cells at the whole organ or embryo level. Harper brings a wealth of experience in single-cell and spatial transcriptomics, having trained with Andrew Ng on foundation models. She will focus on developing spatiotemporal foundation models for single cells.

        <i>Jan 29, 2024:</i> Eric Waters, the new lab manager for the three BASE labs (Gifford, Engreitz, and Qiu), has just started his adventure with us. With a rich background spanning Human Physiology to Computer Science and data science, he is eager to help set up our wet lab space and support the many exciting research projects in our lab. Welcome aboard, Eric!

        <i>Jan 22, 2024:</i> Cinlong Huang, a recent graduate from UC Berkeley, has started working in the Qiu lab as a research assistant. Cinlong will help us set up the wet lab space and explore exciting new frontiers in spatially and temporally resolved single-cell multi-omics. We are delighted to have Cinlong join us for our exciting journey ahead. Welcome, Cinlong!

        <i>Jan 9, 2024:</i> Samuel King from Bioengineering department at Stanford started his rotation in the lab. Samuel is excited about the opportunity to work on synthesizing single cell / spatial genomics with machine learning approach to decipher regulatory mechanism of embryogenesis and organogenesis. We are excited to have Samuel to join the team as the first rotation student. Welcome, Samuel!

        <i>May. 1st, 2025:</i> We are really excited to share that Peter Huangâ€™s rotation project, <i>Expressive Geometric Generative Modeling with Noise-Conditioned Graph Networks</i>, has just been accepted as a poster presentation at ICML! This marks Peterâ€™s first publication as a PhD student, and we are incredibly proud of his initiative, creativity, and perseverance in making this achievement possible. We canâ€™t wait to see what heâ€™ll do next!

        <i>May. 1st, 2025:</i> 
        <p> Welcome to four incredibly talented visiting researchers who have recently joined our lab: Chen Li from Dr. Xuegong Zhangâ€™s lab at Tsinghua University, Qiangwei Peng from Dr. Tiejun Liâ€™s lab at Peking University, Valentina Giunchiglia from Dr. Adam Hampshireâ€™s lab at Imperial College London and Dr. Marinka Zitnikâ€™s lab at Harvard University, and finally, Zehua Zeng, developer of the impressive OmicsVerse framework, from Dr. Hongwu Duâ€™s lab at the University of Science and Technology Beijing. </p>

        <p> Chen will be working on novel approaches to perturbation prediction using foundation models. Qiangwei will focus on modeling mechanical forces during embryogenesis. Valentina will contribute to developing the next generation of multi-modal foundation models. Zehua will dedicate his efforts to building robust frameworks for spatial multi-omics integration.</p>  
      </li>

        <i>Jan. 6st, 2025:</i> ðŸ“¢ Paper Alert!
        <p>Weâ€™re thrilled to share our labâ€™s first single-cell foundation model: Tabula â€” a preprint developed by the incredible Jiayuan Ding! </p>
        <p>ðŸ“„ <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.01.06.631427v1">Paper link</a> </p>
        <p>ðŸ“¦ <a href="https://github.com/aristoteleo/tabula">Code package</a> </p>

        <p>Tabula introduces a novel pretraining strategy â€” tabula learning â€” and integrates federated learning to achieve state-of-the-art performance. Remarkably, it outperforms all existing foundation models using only half the training data. It also demonstrates strong predictive power in uncovering both pairwise and higher-order combinatorial gene regulatory patterns. </p>

        <i>Feb. 1st, 2025:</i> We are thrilled to welcome two talented students join us today: Yifan Lu, a visiting PhD student from Wuhan University in China; Stephen Zhang, a visiting PhD student from the University of Melbourne in Australia. Yifan will be exploring the exciting frontier of applying computer vision approaches to 3D spatial transcriptomics. Stephen has made some exceptional work in single-cell dynamics modeling using optimal transport and is planning to develop spatiotemporal models of single cells at the whole organ or embryo level.

        <i>Nov. 11, 2024:</i> We are thrilled to share that our first paper from the lab, Spateo (https://github.com/aristoteleo/spateo-release) for spatiotemporal modeling of molecular holograms, is now online in <a href="https://cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(24)01159-0">Cell</a>. Spateo is a comprehensive analytical framework for 3D whole-embryo spatiotemporal modeling. This work is also highlighted in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03615-8">Nature</a> and <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-024-02587-x.pdf">Nature Methods</a>. Huge congratulations to Yifan for his phenomenal contribution to this work â€” from building the state-of-the-art 3D reconstruction to pioneering a powerful morphogenesis vector field approach. This wouldnâ€™t have been possible without your brilliance and dedication! ðŸŽ‰

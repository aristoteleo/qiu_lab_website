        <i>Feb. 1st, 2025:</i> We are thrilled to welcome two talented students join us today: Yifan Lu, a visiting PhD student from Wuhan University in China; Stephen Zhang, a visiting PhD student from the University of Melbourne in Australia. Yifan will be exploring the exciting frontier of applying computer vision approaches to 3D spatial transcriptomics. Stephen has made some exceptional work in single-cell dynamics modeling using optimal transport and is planning to develop spatiotemporal models of single cells at the whole organ or embryo level.

        <i>Nov. 11, 2024:</i> We are thrilled to share that our first paper from the lab, Spateo (https://github.com/aristoteleo/spateo-release) for spatiotemporal modeling of molecular holograms, is now online in <a href="https://cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(24)01159-0">Cell</a>. Spateo is a comprehensive analytical framework for 3D whole-embryo spatiotemporal modeling. This work is also highlighted in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03615-8">Nature</a> and <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-024-02587-x.pdf">Nature Methods</a>

        <i>Oct 8, 2024:</i> Xiaojie has been selected for this year’s NIH Director’s New Innovator Award. We are pioneering new approaches that combine machine learning, single-cell/spatial genomics, and systems biology to create predictive models of the virtual heart and whole embryo.

        <i>Jun, 2024:</i> We are thrilled to welcome two talented undergraduate students to our team: Dingcheng Yi from Peking University and Mengchen Wang from Tsinghua University. Dingcheng has an outstanding academic record, ranking No. 2 in his program. Mengchen is part of Tsinghua’s prestigious Yao Class, a special pilot program under the tutelage of Turing Award winner Andrew Chi-Chih Yao. We are excited to have Dingcheng and Mengchen join us in exploring 3D spatial transcriptomics from different perspectives!

    <p>We are looking for self-motivated, passionate, and talented researchers—both dry (e.g., machine learning, computational biology) and wet 
      (e.g., single-cell and spatial genomics). Our lab aims to integrate advances in AI and genomics to dissect molecular mechanisms underlying evolution, development, 
      and disease. We are a multidisciplinary team of biologists, computer scientists, engineers, mathematicians, and physicists working at the frontier of science and 
      technology. We offer an enriching, collaborative training environment where graduate/undergraduate students, postdocs, RAs, staff scientists, and visitors can grow 
      into future leaders in academia and industry.</p>

    <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-7 mb-sm-4">
      <h3 class="highlight">Graduate Students</h3>
      <p>Graduate students from any Stanford department are warmly encouraged to contact Dr. Qiu directly. We frequently receive requests from students from Genetics, 
        Bioengineering, Computer Science, Biomedical Data Science, Biophysics, and other departments at Stanford.</p>
      
      <h3 class="highlight">Undergraduate Students</h3>
      <p>Stanford undergraduates interested in research and honors theses are welcome to reach out. Many of our undergraduates gain research experience and mentorship 
        that helps them successfully apply to top-tier PhD programs.</p>
      
      <h3 class="highlight">Visiting Students</h3>
      <p>We welcome highly motivated visiting undergraduate, Master’s, and PhD students. Due to high interest, selection is highly competitive and must comply with 
        Stanford policies and U.S. visa regulations. Please refer to the Stanford guidelines for visiting undergraduate research interns (UGVI) and visiting student 
        researchers (VSR): <a href="https://studentservices.stanford.edu/more-resources/non-matriculated-student-researchers">Requirements</a>.</p>

      <p>Our lab has a strong track record of mentoring visiting students, many of whom have gone on to top graduate programs (e.g., Stanford, Columbia, USC). For 
        undergraduate and Master’s visitors, Stanford allows only short-term stays (e.g. short summer visit). Visiting PhD students are expected to stay for at least 6 months, 
        with the possibility of extension up to 2 years according to Stanford and J1 visa policy. Long-term visiting students will receive full financial support. Please visit the <a href="/people">people</a> page 
        to learn more about our alumni.</p>

      <h3 class="highlight">Research Assistants, Postdocs & Staff Scientists</h3>            
      <p>We are actively hiring research assistants, postdoctoral fellows, and staff scientists. If you're interested, please email the following materials to Dr. Qiu at 
        <a href="mailto:xiaojie@stanford.edu">xiaojie@stanford.edu</a>:

    <h3 class="highlight">I contacted you and didn’t hear back</h3>
    It is possible that I missed your email. Feel free to send me a reminder if you didn’t hear back after two weeks. If you still didn’t hear back, it is likely that I 
    have read your email but cannot respond due to the high volume of inquiries. Check out this note to see if there are helpful information. Please also consider cc'ed my 
    admin email to <a href="mailto:hadleyb@stanford.edu">hadleyb@stanford.edu</a> if you think it is urgent.

    <p>We are looking for self-motivated, passionate, and talented researchers—both dry (e.g., machine learning, computational biology; remote possible) and wet (e.g., single-cell and spatial genomics). Our lab aims to integrate advances in AI and genomics to dissect molecular mechanisms underlying evolution, development, and disease. We are a multidisciplinary team of biologists, computer scientists, engineers, mathematicians, and physicists working at the frontier of science and technology. We offer an enriching, collaborative training environment where graduate/undergraduate students, postdocs, RAs, staff scientists, and visitors can grow into future leaders in academia and industry.</p>

      <h3 class="highlight">Graduate Students</h3>
      <p>Graduate students from any Stanford department are warmly encouraged to contact Dr. Qiu directly. We frequently collaborate with students from Genetics, Bioengineering, Computer Science, Biomedical Data Science, Biophysics, and beyond.</p>
      
      <h3 class="highlight">Undergraduate Students</h3>
      <p>Stanford undergraduates interested in research and honors theses are welcome to reach out. Many of our undergraduates gain research experience and mentorship that helps them successfully apply to top-tier PhD programs.</p>
      
      <h3 class="highlight">Visiting Students</h3>
      <p>We welcome highly motivated visiting undergraduate, Master’s, and PhD students. Due to high interest, selection is highly competitive and must comply with Stanford policies and U.S. visa regulations. Please refer to the Stanford guidelines for visiting undergraduate research interns (UGRI) and visiting student researchers (VSR): <a href="https://studentservices.stanford.edu/more-resources/non-matriculated-student-researchers">Requirements</a>.</p>

      <p>Our lab has a strong track record of mentoring visiting students, many of whom have gone on to top graduate programs (e.g., Stanford, Columbia, USC). For undergraduate and Master’s visitors, Stanford allows only short-term stays (up to 6 months). Visiting PhD students are expected to stay for at least 6 months, with the possibility of extension up to 2 years. Long-term visiting students receive full financial support. Please visit the <a href="/people">people</a> page to learn more about our alumni.</p>

      <h3 class="highlight">Research Assistants, Postdocs & Staff Scientists</h3>
